Method of preparation:
Take all the ingredients of pharmacopoeial quality.
Clean and wash the ingredients except Asal with purified water to remove the dust. Dry ingredients
in shade under aseptic conditions. Powder the drugs separately using pulverizer, and pass through
80 mesh sieve. Take 1.0 Kg of pure Honey and add 1.0 g of citric acid and 1.0 g of alum to the
content after dissolving them in hot purified water. Mix all the powdered drugs, except Mastagi and

Method of preparation:
Take all the ingredients of pharmacopoieal quality.
Clean the ingredient no.2 and 4 to 9 and 11 and make their coarse powder and soak in 1.00 l of
purified water over night to soften the ingredients along with 600 ml of Araq-e-Gulab. Later, heat
the soaked material gently on low flame till one fourth of the purified water remains, after filtration
and the supernatant is collected. Take 1.00 Kg of sugar and dissolve in 250 ml of purified water and
heat gently to dissolve sugar completely. Add 1g of citric acid and 1g of alum to the content. Add
the collected supernatant of the other ingredients to the sugar solution and heat the content for 30
minutes. The temperature is maintained at 100-1100 to get two tar consistency. Add 1g of sodium
benzoate to the syrupy mass (Qiwam) and boil further for two to three minutes. Discontinue heating
and stir to get light brown khamira. Allow it cool to room temperature and pack in dry air container.

Clean and wash the seeds quickly with running purified water. Soak 1 Kg of seeds in 4.0 l of purified
water, for 24 hours.Boil the content for 10-15 minutes, to separate the mucilage from the seeds, filter
it through a muslin cloth and squeez to get the mucilage (approx. 3.00 l). Dissolve 6 Kg of sugar
in 2.00 l of purified water. Add 0.1% citric acid and 0.1% of alum to the content after dissolving
it in hot purified water. Then add the mucilage to the sugar solution and heat the whole mass for 35
minutes. Remove the slugs, if appears on the surface. Maintain the temperature between 100-110o
to get two tar consistency. Add 0.1% sodium benzoate to the syrupy base (Qiwam) and boil further
for two to three minutes. Discontinue heating with continuous stirring till it becomes whitish brown
mass. Allow it to cool to room temperature and pack in dry tightly closed containers.

Method of preparation:
Take all the ingredients of pharmacopoeial quality.
Clean, dry and powder the ingredients number 1 to 4 and 16 separately and pass through sieve
number 60. Clean, dry and powder the ingredient number 5 to 15 and 17 to 19 and pass through
sieve number 80. Take the required quantity of Asal (Honey), boil on slow heat and filter through
muslin cloth and keep separately. Take required quantity of sugar according to formulation composition,
dissolve in purified water and heat gently to prepare the 77-78 %, consistency qiwam and filter

66
through muslin cloth. Then add the filtered honey to the prepared qiwam and mix thoroughly on slow
heat and remove the container from fire.  While hot conditions add the powder of ingredient number
13 along with 0.1 % of sodium benzoate and mix thoroughly. Then add the coarse powders of
ingredient number 1 to 4 and 16 and mix well, finally add the fine powdered ingredients number 5
to 15 and 17 to 19 and mix thoroughly to make the homogenous product.   Allow to cool to room
temperature. Pack it in tightly closed containers to protect from light and moisture

Method of preparation:
Take all the ingredients of pharmacopoeial quality.
Clean, dry and powder the ingredient numbers 7, 8, 11, 12 and 14 to 25 of the formulation
composition separately and pass through sieve number 80. Clean, dry and powder the ingredient
number 5 and 13 of the formulation composition separately and pass through sieve number 60. Fry
(Biryan) the powdered ingredient number 5 to 8 with the ingredient number 9 and keep separately.
Boil the required quantity of ingredient number 1 to 3 in ingredient number 4 (milk) till they become
soft.  Then remove all the three ingredients from milk and prepare their paste using wet grinder.  The
remaining milk is boiled till it becomes thick, then the temperature is reduced and heat slowly till it
becomes khoya and keep separately.
Dissolve the required quantity of ingredient number 10 in 1000 ml of purified water on slow heat and
at the boiling stage add 0.11% of citric acid.  When the consistency of qiwam reaches 60%, add
the paste of ingredient number 1 to 3, mix well and prepare the qiwam of 74% consistency.  Then,
add ingredient number 4 (milk khoya) and mix well followed by adding fried ingredients number 5
to 8 on slow heat. Discontinue heating and, while hot add the powdered ingredient number 11, 12
and 14 to 25, along with 0.11 % of sodium benzoate and mix thoroughly to prepare the homogenous
product.

 RAUGHANIYAT
Definition:
Raughan (Oil) is a medium which is used in different forms. It is used for making the medicine, as
medicine itself, as one of the ingredients in a particular formula or as medicated oil by mixing with
other drugs of plant, animal or minieral origin. It is mostly used as a base (as in the case of ointment)
and is generally obtained from plant sources. Oil can be extracted from different parts of the plant,
viz. Maghziyat (Kernels of the fruits), Roots, Leaves, Flowers, Seeds and so on. Tila is an allied form
of Raughaniyat and is included in this section.
On the basis of its use, method of extraction and preparation, it is broadly classified into two main
categories:
1. Oil extracted from plant sources for use – Extracted oils.
2. Oil made out of mixing with other medicinal drugs (plant, animal or mineral) for use – Medicated
oils.
Method of Preparation:
Extraction of oil from plant sources is generally done by the methods given in the Unani texts. But
because of the increasing demand and large scale preparation of Unani drugs, manufacturers are now
extracting oil by adopting modern technologies.
Now a days oil is mostly extracted and obtained by Mechanical Process viz.
(i) Cold Expelling Process. (ii) Steam Distillation or Solvent Process. Oil from Kernels (Maghziyat,
Tukhm-e-Sarashf (Mustard Seeds), Tukhm-e-Til (Sesame Seeds) etc., are mostly obtained by Cold
Expelling Process, while oils  from Cloves, Cinnamon and Anise fruits are obtained by Steam
Distillation Process.
For details of extracting and preparing medicated oils refer to Kasheedgi-e-Raughaniyat and Adviyat-
e-Raughaniyat in the chapter “General Methods of Preparation”.
General Precautions
(1)
Extraction of the oils from plant sources, preparation of the medicated oils, crushing of the
ingredient drugs and their mixing should strictly be done according to the methods given on
the chapter “General Methods of Preparation”.
(2)
For the preparation of medicated oil from animal and minieral origin drugs, the methodology
given under the chapter “General Methods of Preparation” should strictly be followed.

103
Characteristics:
Extracted and medicated oils should always be of the required consistency, flavour, color and tests
as given in the Unani texts.
Preservation:
(1)
Extracted or medicated oils can be preserved for one to two years.
(2)
Raughaniyat (Extracted and Medicated Oils) should be preserved in clean and dry glass jar
containers under hygienic conditions in cool and dry place.
